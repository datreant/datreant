"""
The Coordinator object stores information on all Containers it is made aware
of.  This centralized storage allows Containers to find each other more easily
when necessary; this is especially important for Groups. It also provides an
interface for querying the whole set of Containers it is aware of and returning
them; this can remove the need to manually go hunting for Containers in the
filesystem.
