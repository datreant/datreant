API Changes
    * Group object no longer supported; removed (#130)
    * Removed Tree.treants, Treant.treants, View.bundle, Bundle.view,
      Tree.discover, Treant.discover; favor use of classes and functions
      directly for finer control (#114)
    * Namespace package removed; now library called `datreant`


Enhancements
    * Allow numpy integer and boolean slicing for View and Bundle
      (Issue #107)

      and categories (#144)
    * Added ``parents`` property to ``View`` (#133)


Fixes
   * Setting a Category to None will delete any existing value and is
     otherwise not allowed. (Issue #117)

07/13/16 dotsdl, gabrielelanaro, kain88-de, sseyler

    * 0.7.0

API Changes

    * ``Bundle.trees`` -> ``Bundle.view`` and ``View.treants`` ->
      ``View.bundle``; change was made to remove ambiguity of 
      ``Bundle.trees`` in light of ``View.trees``, and to make clear
      that these properties serve as transformations in some way.

Enhancements
    
    * ``Tree.rsync`` method added that allows syncing of Trees
      and Treants to and from remote locations and filesystems
    * ``View.loc``, ``Bundle.loc``, ``Tree.loc`` pandas-like semantics
      added for accessing subtrees.
    * More complete tests for ``AggTags``


Fixes
    
    * Bundles and Views obtained from other Bundles, Views, Trees, or Treants
      automatically get all limbs of the object they were obtained from;
      set operations between Views/Bundles will give unions of their attached
      limbs
    * ``datreant.core.discover`` no longer traverses directories beyond given
      depth, or beyond treantdepth. These parameters now work as expected. #45
    * ``AggCategories.groupby`` preserves key order


Changes

    * Switched from ``pathlib`` to ``pathlib2`` as a dependency for backwards
      compatibility with python < 3.4.

Doc Updates

    * Added conda package installation instructions.



03/23/16 dotsdl, andreabedini, richardjgowers, orbeckst, sseyler
