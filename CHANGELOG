??/??/16 dotsdl

    * 0.7.0

API Changes

    * ``Bundle.trees`` -> ``Bundle.view`` and ``View.treants`` ->
      ``View.bundle``; change was made to remove ambiguity of 
      ``Bundle.trees`` in light of ``View.trees``, and to make clear
      that these properties serve as transformations in some way.

Enhancements


Fixes
    
    * Bundles and Views obtained from other Bundles, Views, Trees, or Treants
      automatically get all limbs of the object they were obtained from;
      set operations between Views/Bundles will give unions of their attached
      limbs
    * ``datreant.core.discover`` no longer traverses directories beyond given
      depth, or beyond treantdepth. These parameters now work as expected. #45


Changes

    * Switched from ``pathlib`` to ``pathlib2`` as a dependency for backwards
      compatibility with python < 3.4.
