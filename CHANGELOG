datreant.core CHANGELOG
=======================

The rules for this file:
  * entries are sorted newest-first.
  * summarize sets of changes - don't reproduce every git log comment here.
  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting
  * accompany each entry with github issue/PR number (Issue #xyz)
  * release numbers follow "Semantic Versioning" http://semver.org

API Changes

    * ``Bundle.trees`` -> ``Bundle.as_View`` and ``View.treants`` ->
      ``View.as_Bundle``; change was made to remove ambiguity of 
      ``Bundle.trees`` in light of ``View.trees``, and to make clear
      that these properties serve as transformations in some way.
